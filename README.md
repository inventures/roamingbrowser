Roaming Browser
==============
This is a basic app which looks and works like Safari but allows you to choose to turn off JS/CSS/images and also tracks data usage and cost whilst browsing the web.

No guarantees made for the quality of the code. I built this project to learn iOS dev and Objective-C. It works and the basic premise is pretty neat but it has not been put together in the most efficient or elegant manner.

It was in the App Store for a while but since our Apple developer subscription has expired, it is now open source. Feel free to fork, hack, re-publish and sell/give-away but please credit original author.
